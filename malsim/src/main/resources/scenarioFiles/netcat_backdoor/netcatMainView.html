        <ul>
          <li>
            You have received an email from the "IT department" instructing you
            to download an update.
          </li>
          <li>
            This update will send a reverse shell back to the attackers
            computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reverse shell will be caught by Metasploit and used to install
            netcat.
          </li>
          <li>
            The shell will also allow the attacker to modify registry keys to
            ensure a connection in the future.
          </li>
        </ul>

          started.
