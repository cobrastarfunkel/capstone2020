          of establishing a persistent connection to a remote server using a
          netcat backdoor. You play both the attacker and the victim in this
          Scenario to give you an idea of the entire process.

          C:\ > The outcome of this Scenario will be an established persitant
          connection to a windows server. You will install a program called
          netcat on the victims computer and modify the system run registry key
          to send back a reverse shell to your attack computer.

          <li>
            You have received an email from the "IT department" instructing you
            to download an update.
          </li>
          <li>
            This update will send a reverse shell back to the attackers
            computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reverse shell will be caught by Metasploit and used to install
            netcat.
          </li>
          <li>
            The shell will also allow the attacker to modify registry keys to
            ensure a connection in the future.
