          the email on the previous screen we have sent a reverse shell back to
          ourselves. Next we will use metasploit to access this shell and modify
          the Windows computer to send us back a shell whenever someone logs in.

          C:\ > To do this we need to download netcat to the windows computer
          and modify a registry key. The modified registry key will run netcat
          and cause it to send a shell back to our kali machine running
          metasploit.

          the registry key. Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload that gives us a
          shell we can use to do almost anything we want on the targets
          computer.
