          <H3>What are they?</H3>
          
          <P> Keyloggers are a type of spyware used to track the keyboard and mouse activities on a subject's computer.
          These tools can be used legitimately or maliciously but the connotation of the term "Keylogger" carries is often negative.
          Different types of malware, including the ones included in this training tool, can be disguised and delivered in different
          ways. Trojans, viruses, and worms can all function as droppers by placing these malicious programs on the victim's machine.
          Simple keyloggers like the one you are about to use can be planted on a victim machine and log keystrokes to a file to 
          later be manually retrieved by an attacker. More advanced keyloggers can send this recorded information through email
          or FTP without any user input making them far more dangerous in real world scenarios. 
        </P>
        <P> <h3>Will this key logger harm my computer?</h3>
          The key logger presented in this exercise will function as a virus. Viruses on computers will not spread without human
          interaction and will always require some form of action from the user. Your interaction with this virus will happen
          in two distinct parts. First, when you launched this scenario the source code for the keylogger was compiled and
          the executable was stored somewhere on your system without you knowing (sorry about that). You will then have to
          launch the executable at which point the key logger will start recording your keystrokes. <B><I>In the event that
          you cannot complete this exercise the key logger will terminate itself after two minutes and will not run again
          unless you explicitly restart the program.</I></B>
          <H2>Let's begin!</H2>
       
       	  <H3>Finding the malware</H3>
          <P> Because viruses need human interaction to spread and infect different computers they are often disguised as something
          enticing. Maybe you've won a bajillion dollars or you're just downloading a program you need for work. Here you've
          opened the malware training tool. The enticing link or file should be easy to find so the user can infect their computer
          without much hassle. Assuming MinGW is installed correctly and this malware simulator is being run with the correct
          permissions you should be able to find the file "keylogger.exe" directly in your C drive.
		  <br/><B>Open your file explorer now and navigate to C:\</B>
          </P><br/>
          <H3>Running the program</H3>
          <P> Now that you have found C:\ on your file system identify the file named "keylogger.exe." Obviously this file could be
          named something much more inconspicuous and raise no alarm. Perhaps it was included in a legitimate program and
          is named something to indicate that it belongs there. Very rarely, if ever, will these files be so easy to detect.
          The program could be hidden somewhere deep inside the file system and be very hard to find, but because it is located
          directly in C:\ it will need administrator permissions to create the file it needs to begin logging key presses. You
          will now launch the keylogger and it will record keystrokes for two minutes.
          <br/><B>Right click keylogger.exe and select "Run as administrator."</B>
          </P><br/>
          <H3>Finding the running process</H3>
          <P> While the keylogger is running it is now a terrible time to enter your full name, social security number, and
          all banking information you can think of. Go ahead and type yourself some gibberish so you can see how the program works.
          <br/><B>Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open the task manager</B>
          </P><br/>
          <H3>Terminating the process</H3>
          <P> While the keylogger is running you should be able to scroll through this alphabetized list until you find "keylogger.exe"
          As was pointed out before this is an incredibly stupid name for something trying to hide and you would have a much more
          difficult time trying to find a program with a name that was more thoroughly hidden.<br/><B>To terminate the keylogger click
          on the process name and select "End task" in the bottom right of the window.</B> Note: If you do not see the process in task
           manager, it is likely the program terminated itself after two minutes.
          </P><br/>
          <H2>Cleaning up the Damage</H2>
          <P> Now that the process has been killed you have nothing to worry about. Right? <I>Nope!</I> The file that recorded your
          keystrokes is still on your computer. This means the attacker can regain access to your machine and recover the
          key presses you made before the process was terminated. Once again, this file could be anywhere on your system in any
          folder with any filename. It can be quite the challenge to find a small text file sitting silently somewhere on your system.
          In this example we have made it simple.<br/><B>Return to C:\ where you found "keylogger.exe"</B>
          </P><br/>
          <P> Here you will find a super secret new file named "SavedKeyPresses.txt" and you will never believe what is inside. In 
          this file you will see the keystrokes you made while the logger was reading your inputs. All you have to do to rid your
          computer of this file is select it and press the delete key like any other file on your system. You may require administrator
          permissions because the file is stored in C:\ but select "Continue" at the prompt to delete this file. <br/><B>Delete 
          SavedKeyPresses.txt and keylogger.exe</B><br/>
          </P>
          <P>In conclusion, every action you took to launch this attack on yourself could be easily taken by someone trying to install 
          a legitimate program. If the keylogger program and text file were located in a folder less sensitive than C:\ no administrator
          permission would be required to begin logging your data. This is one of the easiest and therefore most common attacks you
          are likely to see.
          </P>
