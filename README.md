### Initial Database Setup
Creating Database works, Table can be created, Files can be imported into table by storing them in a directory.  Set the path in the Scenario class.
/src/main/resources/configFiles have examples of how we can use yaml to build scenarios.  These work, if we need to add / remove fields we can.  At the moment the database only has the encrypted executable defined in the config file and an ID number(Malware table) and Scenario Name and id (Scenarios Table).
